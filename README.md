## Introduction

CodeSage is a community-driven platform for learning and sharing knowledge about software development, programming languages, and related technologies. It inspired by StackOverflow, enhanced with AI-powered answers, gamification, recommendations, and more.

This is a fun project that I'm working on to learn and improve my skills in software development especially using Next.js and other latest technology to create a production-ready app.
